# ProjectPlanning / Project Description: 
Our app is called Travel Watcher . It's a budget tracker that helps you plan and  keep better track of your expenses while you are traveling or on a trip. There are input fields for different types of expenses that you can add detials and cost to. You put in the desired budget you have and the expenses are subracted from that desired budget as you add them. If you go over your budget, a button will turn red , letting you know that you need to reconfigure some expenses to stay on track.  

Your expense are tallied and displayed on a card called "Current Trip" so you can get a full picture of your budget and costs. 

Our stretch goals : 
- To have a a trip length data structure 
    - allows for a daily budget breakdown taken from total budget divided by number of days for trip 
    - This would have a day child component that has all of the same categories that the parent trip does
        - day budget and day total comparison so travelers can plan for future expenses during trip
        - day expense categories can be totaled to update total cost of each parent trip expense category 
        - each parent expense category can be displayed and calculated towards overall total
    
- To have your past trips load onto a history page, so you can reference these when planning more future trips. 
- To have user log in fields
