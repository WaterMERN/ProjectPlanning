# ProjectPlanning / Project Description: 
Our app is called Travel Watcher . It's a budget tracker that helps you plan and  keep better track of your expenses while you are traveling or on a trip. There are input fields for different types of expenses that you can add detials and cost to. You put in the desired budget you have and the expenses are subracted from that desired budget as you add them. If you go over your budget, a button will turn red , letting you know that you need to reconfigure some expenses to stay on track.  

Your expense are tallied and displayed on a card called "Current Trip" so you can get a full picture of your budget and costs. 

Our stretch goals : 
-To have your past trips load onto a history page, so you can reference these when planning more future trips. 
-To have user log in fields
